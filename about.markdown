My name is Caden. I am a Software Engineer.

I live in California. My hobbies include reading, video games, and coding. I am a neovim/tmux enthusiast, and I am always interest in ways to make my workflow more efficient.

I studied Computer Science at Reed College. My senior thesis was focused on DNA compression. To see this project and others, check out my [github](https://github.com/cadencorontzos).
